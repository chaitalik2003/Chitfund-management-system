				<p>Financial  system helps to increase the output by moving the economic system towards the  existing production frontiers, by  transforming the given total amount of wealth into productive forms. The  ultimate goal of the financial system is to accelerate  the rate of economic development. The role of the financial system is to  channelize funds from surplus units to  deficit units. The supply of funds depends upon aggregate savings and credit  creation by the banking system, while need  of funds depends upon demand for investment, consumer durables, housing and so  on. The main function of financial  system is to establish a bridge between savers and investors and thereby to  encourage saving and investment. Thus  a financial system helps to increase the volume of investment. It becomes  possible for the deficit spending units to  undertake more investment because it would enable them to command more capital.. </p>
